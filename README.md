# NYPH-PROJECT

The goal of this project is to better predict procedure duration in 4 services within the New York Presbyterian Hospital. A linear regression model was chosen due to its flexibility, scaleability, and ability to easily understand for the hospital staff. 

The outcome variable was procedure duration, and the predictors were as follows:

- original scheduled duration of procedure
- age of patient
- ASA of patient (health rating on a scale of 1 - 5)
- operating surgeon
- emergency status
- room number and facility
- type of anesthesia
